### PQW-003: Re-link the Genkei Labs footer to genkeilabs.com
**Priority**: Low
**Description**: The footer says "Brought to you by Genkei Labs," and during the rebrand it linked to https://genkeilabs.com — but that site isn't built yet, so the link was removed (a dead link is worse than none) and the text left in place. Once the Genkei Labs site is live, re-wrap "Genkei Labs" in the footer with the link to https://genkeilabs.com. See the `TODO(PQW-003)` comment in `src/components/Footer.tsx`.

### PQW-015: Guard against duplicate `<h1>` in MDX blog posts
**Priority**: Low
**Description**: `mdx-components.tsx` maps markdown `#` to `<h1>`, but `PostHeader` already renders the post title as `<h1>` — a post body starting with `#` would produce two. Downshift the MDX `h1` mapping to `<h2>`, or document that post bodies must start at `##`.

### PQW-016: Footer copyright year is baked at build time
**Priority**: Low
**Description**: `new Date().getFullYear()` in `src/components/Footer.tsx` runs at build time in a static page, so the year only advances on redeploy. Harmless for an actively deployed site — fix opportunistically or accept.

### PQW-023: Launch a blog newsletter (blocked: needs execution plan)
**Priority**: Low
**Description**: Owner intends to start a newsletter but is holding off until there's a plan for producing content (as of 2026-08-10, no provider account exists and no first-post timeline). When ready: pick a provider, create the account, then restore the newsletter CTA in `src/components/blog/PostFooter.tsx` (removed under PQW-012 — recover the block from git history) pointing at the real signup endpoint, and re-add the blog hunt assertion for the form. Do not un-block this item until the provider account actually exists.
